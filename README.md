## About
A simple Library Management System App made using vanilla JS and Web Storage API to store the books issued. Admin can add a field with the type of book, author and with the name of the issuer who issued that book and can delete that field once the books is returned. Admin can search the books with author and name of the issuer using the search bar.

## Tech Stack Used
HTML,CSS,Javascript
      
## Lessons Learned
My learning was focused on making the use of Web Storage API and to create a simple UI and a smooth UX for the admin to easily issue books without adding the data to the database and store the books issued in the browser itself.
Seperation of Concerns - Separating the application into distinct sections, so each section addresses a separate concern. Learned how the web storage API works and difference between local storage and session storage.
